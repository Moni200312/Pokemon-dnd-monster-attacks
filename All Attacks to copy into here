        When you take the Dash action, you gain extra movement for the current
        turn. The increase equals your speed, after applying any modifiers. With
        a speed of 30 feet, for example, you can move up to 60 feet on your turn
        if you dash.


        Any increase or decrease to your speed changes this additional movement by the same amount. If your speed of 30 feet is reduced to 15 feet, for instance, you can move up to 30 feet this turn if you dash

        First, you decide what perceivable circumstance will trigger your reaction. Then, you choose the action you will take in response to that trigger, or you choose to move up to your speed in response to it.


        When the trigger occurs, you can either take your reaction right after the trigger finishes or ignore the trigger.


        When you ready a spell, you cast it as normal but hold its energy, which you release with your reaction when the trigger occurs. To be readied, a spell must have a casting time of 1 action, and holding onto the spell’s magic requires concentration. If your concentration is broken, the spell dissipates without taking effect. For example, if you are concentrating on the web spell and ready magic missile, your web spell ends, and if you take damage before you release magic missile with your reaction, your concentration might be broken.

        to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces
        one of them.


        The target of your grapple must be no more than one size larger than you and must be within your reach. Using at least one free hand, you try to seize the target by making a grapple check instead of an attack roll: a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target’s Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use). You succeed automatically if the target is incapacitated. If you succeed, you subject the target to the grappled condition. The condition specifies the things that end it, and you can release the target whenever you like (no action required).

            use a bonus action to cause a blade of pure radiance to spring into
            existence, or make the blade disappear. While the blade exists, this
            magic longsword has the finesse property. If you are proficient with
            shortswords or longswords, you are proficient with the sun blade.


            You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon, which deals radiant damage instead of slashing damage. When you hit an undead with it, that target takes an extra 1d8 radiant damage.


            The sword's luminous blade emits bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim light for an additional 15 feet. The light is sunlight. While the blade persists, you can use an action to expand or reduce its radius of bright and dim light by 5 feet each, to a maximum of 30 feet each or a minimum of 10 feet each.

            turn or until you are incapacitated. While the aura is active, you
            have resistance to lightning and thunder damage. In addition, attack
            rolls against you have disadvantage, and whenever another creature
            starts its turn within the aura, you can force the creature to make
            a Strength saving throw (DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + the
            modifier of the ability increased by this feat). On a failed save,
            the creature's speed is halved until the start of its next turn. You
            can use this bonus action a number of times equal to your
            proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish
            a long rest.
